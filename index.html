            What Was Operation Overlord?
        </h2>
         <p class="home_p">
            Operation Overlord was the codename assigned to the invasion of Western Europe from the allied forces during the latter years of World War 2.
            The operation was officially launched on 6th June 1944 and ended on 30th August 1944, lasting 2 months, 3 weeks and 3 days. Over these few months hundreds of thousands of men would lose their lives in the fighting.

           D-day
        </h2>
        <p class="home_p">
           The initial landings at the beaches of Normandy on 6th June 1944 were codenamed Operation Neptune by the allied forces, but they are more commonly known as D-Day. The "D" in D-day simply stands for "Day", the term was used for the first day of any large scale military operation.
        </p>
        <p class="home_p">
            The decision to launch a full scale invasion of Europe was made at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Conference_(1943)" target="_blank" alt="Link to Washingtone Conference Wikipedia page (opens in new tab)">Washington Conference in 1943 (codenamed Trident)</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="home_p">
            Allied forces landed on 5 beaches along the coast of France, they gave each beach its own codename, they were: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. The Nazi fortifications along the coast of France were unfinished as resources had been diverted elsewhere,making the invasion much easier for the Allied forces. Thousands died on both sides but eventually the Allies were able to successfully take the beaches and secured their position in Western Europe.

          The Push
        </h2>
        <p class="home_p">
           After the successful initial landings in Normandy, the Allied continued pushing in to the rest of Western Europe. These advances were part of smaller operations that were all considered as parts of Operation Overlord, these smaller operations included:
           <p class="home_p"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bodyguard" target="_blank" alt="Link to Wikipedia page for Operation Bodyguard (opens in new tab)">Operation Bodyguard</a> which was launched before the invasions, it's objective was to feed the Nazi forces flase information. The operation was deemed successful and greatly attributed to the Allied victory.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="home_p"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dragoon" target="_blank" alt="Link to Wikipedia page for Operation Dragoon (opens in new tab)">Operation Dragoon</a> sought to secure vital ports in the South of France.It was initially meant to be launched simultaneously with the Normandy landings but was delayed as the ports would not be able to sufficiently supply Allied troops in their initial state.</p>
        <p class="home_p"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Day_naval_deceptions#Glimmer_and_Taxable" target="_blank" alt="Link to Wikipedia page for Operations Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum">Operations Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum</a> were launched alongside Operation Neptune, there were intended as a distraction for the Nazi forces by creating false radar traffic in the air and sea, Big Drum was strictly naval however. . All three operations were considered successful. </p>
       <p class="home_p"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dingson" target="_blank" alt="Link to Wikipedia page for Operation Dingson (opens in new tab)">Operation Dingson</a> was a French conducted operation that involved the deployment of 178 paratroopers of the 4th Special Air Service. Their objective was to organise a secret base for the French Resistance behind enemy lines, they were initially successful in this, however, the base was eventually discovered and sieged, forcing the men to flee. Corporal Émile Bouétard died during the operation, believed to be the first man to die as part of Operation Overlord. </p>
       <p class="home_p"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Samwest" target="_blank" alt="Link to Wikipedia ppage for Operation Samwest (opens in new tab)">Operation Samwest</a> was conducted simultaneously with Operation Dingson and was conducted by the same 4th Special Air Service. Their objectives were also to organise a secret base for the French Resistance and similarly to Dingson they were initially succsful but the discovered by the Nazis and were forced to flee the base after it was attacked. </p>
       <p class="home_p"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Lost" target="_blank" alt="Link to Wikipedia page for Operation Lost (opens in new tab)">Operation Lost</a> was a much smaller operation, consisting of only seven men that were deployed with the objective of discovering what happened to the base set up in Operation Dingson. They also found and re-organised resistance fighters that were forced to flee by Nazi forces.</p>
       <p class="home_p"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cooney" target="_blank" alt="Link to Wikipedia page for Operation Cooney (opens in new tab)">Operation Cooney</a> was also conducted by the French 4th Special Air Service and had the objective of disrupting Nazi communication shortly after the invasion began. The operation was considered a success. </p>
