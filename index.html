            Operation Overlord was the codename assigned to the invasion of Western Europe from the allied forces during the latter years of World War 2.
            The operation was officially launched on 6th June 1944 and ended on 30th August 1944, lasting 2 months, 3 weeks and 3 days. Over these few months hundreds of thousands of men would lose their lives in the fighting.
